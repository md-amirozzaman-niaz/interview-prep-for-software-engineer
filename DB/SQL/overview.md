# SQL Database Overview and Use Cases

## What is an SQL Database?

SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use a structured format for defining and manipulating data. They store data in tables consisting of rows and columns, and data is accessed using SQL queries.

## Use Cases

### Traditional Business Applications

SQL databases are commonly used in traditional business applications for storing and managing structured data, such as customer information, product catalogs, sales transactions, and inventory records.

### Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence

SQL databases are used for data warehousing and business intelligence applications, where large volumes of data are analyzed to gain insights into business trends, customer behavior, and market conditions.

### Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)

SQL databases are used for online transaction processing (OLTP) applications, where transactions are processed in real-time, and data integrity and consistency are critical. Examples include e-commerce platforms, banking systems, and airline reservations systems.

### Content Management Systems (CMS)

SQL databases are used in content management systems (CMS) for storing and managing textual content, multimedia assets, user profiles, and access control lists. Examples include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.

### Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

SQL databases are used in customer relationship management (CRM) systems for storing customer information, sales leads, and interactions with customers. Examples include Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, and Zoho CRM.
