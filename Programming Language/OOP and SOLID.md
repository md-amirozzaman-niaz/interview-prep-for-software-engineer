# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles

## 1. Encapsulation

- **Principle**: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behavior) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It hides the internal state of objects and restricts direct access to data, allowing access only through well-defined interfaces (methods).

## 2. Abstraction

- **Principle**: Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features of an object. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, making the system easier to understand and maintain.

## 3. Inheritance

- **Principle**: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability, extensibility, and modularity by defining a hierarchical relationship between classes.

## 4. Polymorphism

- **Principle**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables dynamic binding of methods at runtime and allows for code flexibility and extensibility. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

## 5. SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for a set of five design principles that help developers create more maintainable, scalable, and flexible software systems:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or function.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that new features should be added without modifying existing code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Instead of having large, monolithic interfaces, break them down into smaller, more specific interfaces.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

## Conclusion

OOP principles provide a foundation for designing and developing software systems that are modular, maintainable, and scalable. By following these principles, developers can create code that is easier to understand, test, and maintain.
