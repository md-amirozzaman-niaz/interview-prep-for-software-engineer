# Design Patterns Overview

Design patterns are categorized into three main categories:

## 1. Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

### Singleton Pattern

- Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

### Factory Method Pattern

- Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Abstract Factory Pattern

- Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## 2. Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition or the structure of classes.

### Adapter Pattern

- Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an object with a new interface.

### Decorator Pattern

- Adds new functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure.

### Composite Pattern

- Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Clients can treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## 3. Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects.

### Observer Pattern

- Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Strategy Pattern

- Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Command Pattern

- Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

## Conclusion

Design patterns provide tested solutions to recurring design problems in software development. By understanding and applying these patterns, developers can improve the maintainability, scalability, and flexibility of their software systems.
